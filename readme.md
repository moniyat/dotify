# HW3 - Fragments, Activity Lifecycle, & Rotation
## Moniyat Chowdhury

This project is supposed to show different screens of sotify using fragments, whose orientation can be changed to landscape or portrait. 

For some reason the gradle build fails so I run the emulator but the app itself runs I believe

It comes up with this error: Error: The processing instruction target matching "[xX][mM][lL]" is not allowed. 

Which I'm not sure what that means
